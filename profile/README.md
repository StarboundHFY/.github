# Starbound HFY

They pride themselves for their human written and narrated stories, instead of the `AI` options that abound in this niche universe of science fiction.

## The Battle Plan

This is a list of phases and tasks to achieve a centralization of the data about all the series and episodes that the team dishes out at a pace of two per day.

### Phase I

The Discord Server.

After some initial efforts, I'm still unable to get the writers or narrators on board with the Discord Server. Guess I'll need to try harder!

- [ ] Get the writers and the narrators on board with appropriate roles.
- [ ] Customize the server to better suit the needs and format of the community.

### Phase II

Various tools to disseminate the information about series, episodes, narrators, characters and species.

- [ ] Build a database of the series, episodes, narrators, characters and species.\
  Completion: ~70%
- [ ] Build a `Web API` that serves that database.\
  Completion: ~30%\
  (Still noodling about what technology to use for the update and maintenance of the `Web API`'s data)
- [ ] Build a Discord bot that consumes the above mentioned `Web API`.\
  Completion: Not started yet
- [ ] Possibly build a website that will display the content of the `Web API` in a better manner than the Discord Bot.\
  Completion: Not started yet

### Phase III

Pass the mantle of administration to the proper owners of the brand.

- [ ] Relinquish the ownership of the Discord Server to the proper owners of this brand.
